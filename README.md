## Description
**Time Out : Page Blocker** is a Chrome extension and productivity tool, designed to help you stay focussed.

The extension blocks websites of your choosing, enabling you to us your internet browswer productively without getting distracted by troublesome websites. However unlike other pwebsite blockers, Time Out will prompt you to hold down a button for a set time in order to reach the website. This has the advantage of giving you the user the choice of whether you want to complete a visit to the site in any given moment, while also giving you time to pause and think.

### Blurb
*Do you find yourself distracted by the same websites throughout the day, wishing there was a way to intervene?*

***Time Out : Page Blocker** is designed to interrupt you and block access when visiting distracting or troublesome websites.  However, unlike other page blocking plugins, Time Out alwyas gives you the choice whether you want to complete a visit to the website.*

*Instead of using blanket rules to block specific sites at specific times (leading you to disable the blocker each time you **actually** want to visit the site), Time Out challenges you to hold down a button for a set length of time in order to reach the website. This gives you the time to pause and think: "Did I really want to visit this site?"*
