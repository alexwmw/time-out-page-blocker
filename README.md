## Description

**Time Out : Page Blocker** is a Chrome extension and productivity tool, designed to help you stay focussed.

The extension blocks websites of your choosing, enabling you to use your internet browswer productively without getting
distracted by troublesome websites.

However, unlike other website blockers that make it impossible for you to reach the blocked website, **Time Out** will
prompt you to hold down a button for a set time if you decide you really did want to visit the page.

However, unlike other website blockers that make it impossible for you to reach the blocked website, **Time Out** will
prompt you to hold down a button for a set time if you decide you really did want to visit the page.

This gives you the choice of whether you want to complete a visit to the site in any given moment, while also giving you
time to pause and think.

This is an advantage over other website blocker that always block web pages, which can get frustrating and result in the
user disabling the extension altogether.
