  ### Version ${manifest.version}
  ### Description
  
  **Time Out : Page Blocker** is a Chrome extension and productivity tool, designed to help you stay focussed.

  **Time Out** blocks websites of your choosing, enabling you to use your internet browser productively without getting distracted by troublesome websites. 
  
  However, unlike other website blockers that make it impossible for you to reach the blocked website, **Time Out** will prompt you to hold down a button for a set time if you decide you really did want to visit the page.
  
  This gives you the choice of whether you want to complete a visit to the site in any given moment, while also giving you time to pause and think. 
  
  This is an advantage over other website blocker that always block web pages, which can get frustrating and result in the user disabling the extension altogether.
  
  ### Add to blocked list
  
  There are two ways to add sites to the block list:
  
  1. Via the extension popup, which can be opened by clicking the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar
  2. Via context menus which can usually be accessed by right-clicking on a webpage
  `,
  `
  Only pages which start with **http://** or **https://** can be blocked. You may need to double click the URL bar to see this.
  
  When adding a page to the block list, you can chose to either block via the root domain (usually the bit that ends in **.com**), or the full web address.
  
  By default, any subpage which starts with a blocked address will also be blocked. This can be toggled on or off in the **block list** tab.
  
  ### Visiting a blocked site
  
  If you try to visit a site on your block list, you will be redirected to the **Time Out** page, where you will be required to hold a button to view the page. The length of time you are required to hold the button can be edited under the **settings** tab.
  
  Once you have unblocked a site, you will be free to view it for a few minutes - provided you have allowed this in **settings**.
  
  If you have have turned on **scheduling**, sites will only be blocked during scheduled hours.
